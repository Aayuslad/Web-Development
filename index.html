            <strong>A blockchain is a distributed ledger </strong>
            <mark>with growing lists of records (blocks) that are</mark>
            <del>securely</del> linked together via cryptographic hashes.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a
            cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally
            represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each
            block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain
            (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones
            before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are
            recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering
            all subsequent blocks. Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P)
            computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere
            to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although
            blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains
            may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with
            high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5] A blockchain was created by a person (or group of
            people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public
            distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by
            Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.[6] The implementation of the
            blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the
            double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The
            bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2] and blockchains that are readable
            by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered
            a type of payment rail.[7]
